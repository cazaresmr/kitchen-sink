		<h1>My Topic of Interest: Prometheus and the Theft of Fire</h1>
		<p>
			One day, Zeus distributed gifts to all the gods, but he didn't care much for humans. The Titan
			Prometheus, however, because he loved and felt sorry for humans, climbed up on Olympus and
			stole the fire from Hephaestus' workshop, put it in a hollow reed and gifted it to the humans.
			This way, humans could create fire, warm up and make tools. Zeus became very angry when he
			heard about this. He took Prometheus to a high mountain, the Caucasus, and chained him on a
			rock with thick chains made by the smith god, Hephaestus. And every day, Zeus would send an
			eagle that ate Prometheus’ liver. For thirty years Prometheus remained bound in the Caucasus,
			until the great hero Hercules, Zeus’ demigod son, released him finally from his torment.

			<h2>Favorite Movie: The Godfather</h2>
			<img src="./theGodfather.jpeg" width="200" alt="The Godfather movie poster" />
			<p>
				From the wise guys of Goodfellas to The Sopranos, all crime dynasties that came after The
				Godfather are descendants of the Corleones: Francis Ford Coppola’s magnum opus is the
				ultimate patriarch of the Mafia genre. A monumental opening line (“I believe in America”)
				sets the operatic Mario Puzo adaptation in motion, before Coppola’s epic morphs into a
				chilling dismantling of the American dream. The corruption-soaked story follows a powerful
				immigrant family grappling with the paradoxical values of reign and religion; those moral
				contradictions are crystallized in a legendary baptism sequence, superbly edited in parallel
				to the murdering of four rivaling dons. With countless iconic details—a horse’s severed
				head, Marlon Brando’s wheezy voice, Nino Rota’s catchy waltz—The Godfather’s authority lives
				on.—Tomris Laffly
